# HackBU Boilerplate
A starting point for working on small HTML + CSS + JavaScript projects.

## What This Is
The HackBU Boilerplate is a _very_ barebones project containing everything you need to get started working on an HTML project. It provides you with an `index.html` file that you can start filling out, along with starter CSS files, and a basic project layout for putting your own files in.

## How to Use the HackBU Boilerplate
Using the boilerplate couldn't be simpler:
1. Click "Download ZIP" in the sidebar on the right.
2. Unzip the download and open up the directory in your favorite text editor.
3. Get to work!

You can edit the provided files to your heart's content. This README.md file is included for you to edit as well: remove this description and add your own so that others looking through your code can get a feel for what you're working on.

When working on your project, put any JavaScript code you're working on in the `js` folder, any images you'll be using in the `img` folder, and any of your CSS in the `css` folder (we've already provided a `main.css` file for you to start editing) -- this is common in a lot of web development projects, and will help keep you organized and your files from sprawling all over the place. Plus, anyone who's worked on web development in the past will be able to immediately recognize your project's structure.

### Now get to hacking!
